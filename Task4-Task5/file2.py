'''1. Write a program in Python to find out the character in a string which is uppercase using list
comprehension.'''

s1 = input("enter the string ")
lst =[i for i in s1 if i.isupper()]          ##list comprehension
print(lst)

'''2. Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.'''

##1st method
students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']                        
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
dict1 = {students[i]:subjects[i] for i in range(len(students))}   ##using dictionary
print("Result of the dictionary is", dict1)

##2nd method using zip function

students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] 
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
dictionary = dict(zip(students,subjects))
print(dictionary)

#3rd method using for loop

students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] 
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
dictionary = {}
for i in range(len(students)):
    key = students[i]
    value = subjects[i]
    dictionary[key] = value
    
print(dictionary)

'''4. Write a program in Python using generators to reverse the string.'''
